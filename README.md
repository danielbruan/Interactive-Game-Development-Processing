Problem:
Design and implement an interactive application that responds to user input, manages game state, and enforces rule-based logic in real time.

Approach:
Built a 2D game using Processing, focusing on system logic, state management, and user interaction. 
Implemented conditional logic, loops, functions, and event handling to control gameplay flow, scoring, and difficulty.

Tools & Skills
Processing (Java-based)
Logical problem solving
System design & rule definition
Debugging and iteration
User interaction design

Key Learnings / Insights:
Translating abstract rules into executable logic
Managing changing states (start, play, win/lose)
Handling edge cases and user-driven events
Iterative testing and refinement based on behaviour

This project demonstrates my ability to:
Break down complex problems into structured logic
Design systems with clear rules and outcomes
Think in terms of workflows and state transitions
Build and test solutions iteratively
